  The Tick Divider has an invokee connector meant to be called at a periodic rate. This invokee connector will usually be connected to a component which services a periodic hardware tick, or the Ticker component, which simulates a hardware tick. The Tick Divider takes this periodic rate and divides it into subrates which are divisions of the original rate. These divisors are provided via an init routine. Ticks are forwarded out the Tick_T_Send arrayed output connector according to the provided divisors. The priority of the output ticks is determined by the order of the connections in the connector array. The first connector in the array has the highest priority, and should be connected to the output that needs to run first.

  The component supports two tick counting modes: Internal mode (default) uses an internal counter that increments with each received tick and rolls over at a calculated maximum to ensure proper divisor alignment. Tick_Counter mode uses the Count field from incoming ticks directly for division calculations, allowing external control of the counting sequence.

  - description: This unconstrained arrayed connector is connected to downstream components which require a Tick to be scheduled. Each index of the array will be called at a rate equal to the rate at which the Tick_Recv_Sync connector is called, divided by the divisor provided during initialization.
