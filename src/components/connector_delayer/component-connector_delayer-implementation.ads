-- Connector_Delayer Component Implementation Spec
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- This component is similar to the Connector Queuer component except that it
-- delays (via sleep) the transmission of the sent data for a configurable (at
-- initialization) amount of time prior. When configured to sleep for zero
-- microseconds, this component behaves identically to the Connector Queuer. This
-- component can be used for a variety of purposes, such as 1) serving as an
-- alarm, transmitting data N us after receipt or 2) spacing out the transmission
-- of data, sending out new data every N us.
-- Like the Connector Queuer, this component serves as a multi-tasking safe
-- synchronization point for multiple callers. When the T_Recv_Async connector is
-- called, the data is queued. Based on the priority of this component, the data
-- will be safely dequeued in the future, the component will then sleep for the
-- configurable amount of microseconds, and then, finally, the T_Send connector
-- will be called. The queue is implemented using the standard Adamant queue, and
-- thus calls are serviced in FIFO order. The queue protection mechanism
-- effectively makes all downstream connector calls of this component thread-safe.
